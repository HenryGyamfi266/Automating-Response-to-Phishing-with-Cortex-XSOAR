**Task1**
1. In this section, I focused on understanding phishing and exploring how Cortex XSOAR can enhance response capabilities. 
2. Phishing, a social engineering attack via fraudulent emails, poses significant challenges for current systems, often requiring complex, time-consuming, and error-prone manual processes across multiple tools. 
3. With Cortex XSOAR, I am able to address these limitations by providing automation and orchestration capabilities that streamline phishing response. 
4. By integrating various tools and automating actions, it enables faster, more accurate, and efficient handling of phishing incidents.

**Task2**- Investigating Phishing Incidents
1. First thing I did, was to get access to Cortex XSOAR. On the platform, I go to Incidents at the bottom left on the platform and set the Created range to All times.
2. Clicked New Incident to create a new incident on the platform. 
3. After creating incident, I set the workshopscenario to Phishing Campaign and Type to Scenario. Then, clicked Create New Incident.
4. While waiting for the incident generation, opened any existing incident to view more information about it. 
5. Then i investigated the phishing incident created by:
While within Incidents, entered in the search bar the parameter below to filter for incidents that use the Email Phishing playbook.
# playbook:"Email Phishing"
6. Then selected the most recent incident to view more information about it.
Noticed the Status of the incident listed as Active. 
7. Clicked Case Info tab. Took time to review the case details, timeline, notes, and evidence.
8. Clicked the Investigation tab. Reviewed the contents of the e-mail, including any associated indicators, and incident files.

**Task3**-Incident War Room & Work Plan
In this part, I work within XSOAR War Rooms and Work Plans to understand and remediate phishing incidents.
1. Navigated to the incident's War Room to view a consolidated pane of all the events related to the phishing incident and clicked on the War Room tab
2. At the bottom of this page, a message stated the execution of the Work Plan has been paused.
I Clicked Complete in Task pane → Open in Work Plan.
3. Then, navigated to the incident's Work Plan to view the steps and actions taken to respond to  phishing incident. 
The Work Plan provided a visual representation of the steps and actions to be taken when responding to specific security incidents or events.
4. Since I already had investigated the email, clicked Mark Completed.
5. The Work Plan progressed the task to Assign and involve appropriate personnel. Clicked Mark Completedbecause I didn't need other personnel to help with the incident. 
6. The Work Plan progressed the task to, Assess severity. Clicked Mark Completed.
7. The Work Plan progressed the task to, Are the hostnames in the urls being misrepresented? Clicked Mark Completed.
8. The Work Plan was now marked as completed. I explored the tasks in the Work Plan for additional information and insights

**Task4**- Generate Report
1. While within the Incident, went to Case Info → Actions → Report.
2. Set Select a tab to generate report from to Case info. Then, clicked Generate report.
3. Hovered over the XSOAR logo on the top left, and clicked on Dashboards & Reports. Clicked the Reports tab to download the report to my machine.

In this project, I used Cortex XSOAR to respond to phishing incidents, learned how to generate reports, navigated War Room, and completed Work Plans and playbooks.
