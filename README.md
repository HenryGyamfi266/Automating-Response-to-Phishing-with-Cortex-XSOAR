# Automating-Response-to-Phishing-with-Cortex-XSOAR

## Overview

### Cortex XSOAR is an extended security orchestration and automation platform that simplifies security operations by unifying,
### automation, case management, real-time collaboration, and threat intelligence management
In this project, I use Cortex XSOAR (XSOAR) to automate incident response to phishing attacks.
The project uses a real spear phishing attack against a fictional bank, Galactic Ministry of Finance, by infiltrating the bank's e-mail server. 
After infiltration, the attacker sends phishing e-mails to executives at a partnering bank, Bordeaux Bank, during peak business hours.

## Objectives
My goals in this project are to:
Investigate incidents using Cortex XSOAR.
Understand Cortex XSOAR War Rooms.
Create an incident Response Plan with Cortex XSOAR.
